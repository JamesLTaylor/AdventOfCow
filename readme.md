# The Advent of Cow

Cow is a language that aims to be inclusive to cows by only using words that cows can say such as "moo".  
See the [COW webpage](http://bigzaphod.github.com/COW/) for more information.

This project is a python interpreter for Cow and an attempt at a question from the [Advent of Code]https://adventofcode.com/
